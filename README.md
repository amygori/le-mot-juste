This is a word guessing game in Node and Express, using the [Words API](https://www.wordsapi.com/) to generate a random word.

The application runs locally on port 3000 with `npm start`

To run in debug mode, run `npm run-script debug`. See [Paul Irish's article](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27)
